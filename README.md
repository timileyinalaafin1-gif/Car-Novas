# Your Car Website

This is a lightweight static car website scaffold created to match the provided requirements.

Files created:
- `index.html` — Home page with hero and features
- `explore-cars.html` — Listings (New / Used / Certified)
- `shop-buy.html` — Categories and brands
- `about-us.html` — About
- `contact.html` — Contact and locations with form and map embed
- `assets/css/styles.css` — Core styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — Minimal JS for mobile nav toggles
- `assets/data/cars.json` — Example car data

How to view locally

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. On Windows you can double-click the file or run from PowerShell:

```powershell
start .\index.html
```

Deployment

- GitHub Pages: push repository and enable Pages from the repository settings.
- Netlify: drag-and-drop the folder into Netlify or connect to your Git repo.

Next steps I can do for you
- Improve visual design and typography
- Add searchable/filterable inventory (client-side JS)
- Add a build step and asset optimization
- Create a small admin demo to add/remove cars (static JSON)

Tell me which next step you'd like me to implement.
